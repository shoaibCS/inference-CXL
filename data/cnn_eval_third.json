The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, was told that her cancer is in remission. 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram. Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Wednesday that his daughter Leah's cancer was in remisison . Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease . 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram . He went on to say; 'After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her.' He then went on to thank everyone from the doctors who helped his daughter to those who wrote her notes and everyone who shared her story. Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy. She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research. In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment. Leah and her dad have also written a book that aims to help children who are battling the disease . The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance . Leah's MBIG scans showed no active disease in her body, though the family is still waiting on an MRI and bone biopsy results . Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys. The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play. The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage. June 2, 2014 and March 25, 2015 are days I will remember for the rest of my life. As everyone probably knows, June 2nd was the day doctors walked into the waiting room to tell me my daughter had cancer. It was the most devastating day of my life. March 25th , however, is feeling like the best day of my life. Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION! After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her. It was not easy but every day, and every treatment Leah fought like hell and kicked cancers butt! I'm so proud and blessed to call her my daughter. She has made an impact on me and on the world, at the age of four, that I can only wish to make in a lifetime. Thank you to my family and friends for the support through all those tough days. Thank you to everyone who has sent a letter to give Leah and our family motivation to keep fighting, a toy that helped Leah get through her days in the hospital, and more importantly a prayer that helped God hear our cries for healing. Thank you to the doctors at CHOP for putting together the best plan of action for my daughter. Thank you to Child Life members Sarah, Laura, and Lindsey for really turning what could be a scary place into a place where Leah would enjoy going because she knew she would have fun with you guys. Thank you to the Bengals for taking on my situation and standing by me and my family and for helping to raise money to fight pediatric cancer. To every media outlet and persons that helped raise much needed awareness, thank you. Leah is not done with treatments yet. She still needs more to make sure the cancer cells do not return and to build back up her immune system and other damage from the chemo but I know my little warrior will get through it!",

Basing himself on the fraudster who posed as a pilot and inspired the Hollywood movie Catch Me If You Can, the socialite has shared a host of controversial hacks on how he secures upgrades and better hotel rooms when travelling. His video tips, which can only be taken as tongue-in-cheek, appears to show the young globetrotter adopting multiple personas as he travels in order to achieve elite status at airports. Justin claims that he uses the first class lounge as an office space because there is WIFI, free food and unlimited alcohol . He claims that he doesn’t scam airlines, but instead takes advantage of where there are holes before referring to himself as an ‘international Jew jetter’ – a term he uses to describe his lifestyle. He then states that people find serenity in places like central park and that he finds his grounded at JFK airport. ‘I use the first class lounge as an office space. There’s WIFI, free food, unlimited alcohol,’ he says. Justin has a tip for getting your seat moved during a flight and it involves chutz pah and a bag of peanuts . ‘Why spend money on an office space when I can just come here?’ It is at this point that the socialite begins revealing hacks by explaining to the viewer what it is they have to do if they want to stay in the first class lounge for free all day. And, according to Justin, it’s as simple as buying a refundable ticket to get past security and cancelling it at the end of the day. The American socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale, the con-artist the film ‘Catch Me If You Can’ is centred around . Depart at arrivals . According to Justin the best way to arrival at an airport is to do so via arrivals. This way there is no queuing while getting in and you are only required to use a single escalator once through the doors. Never lose your luggage . It’s the age-old problem with airlines, the worry of losing your luggage. But Justin has an inadvisable way of supposedly ensuring that doesn't happen. He believes that by simply packing a gun – not necessarily a real one – and then declaring it will ensure the airline keeps a close eye on baggage throughout the journey. Get your seat moved . Now on the plane, Justin has a tip for getting away from someone you don’t want to be sitting next to. Involving a prop this time, the socialite recommends crushing a packet of peanuts, feigning an allergy and simply requesting to be moved. Upgrade your room . So you’ve arrived at the hotel but you don’t like your room. Justin has the solution. By doing ‘at least 45 minutes worth of research’ the socialite looks for the most empowered, weakest link among the staff and appears to prey upon them with complaints until they break. Business cards . Finally Justin recommends getting yourself an array of business cards, which show that you work for a number of different businesses. This way if there is a particular offer for that company you are eligible for it. Next the socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale by suggesting that he has ‘chutz pah’ (shameless audacity) just like him. The video concludes with Justin reading through some of the hate mail he has received before stating that he is doing something right because he has given them something to talk about. And noting that he would hate to be normal. The video shows Justin supposedly talking to the 'most empowered, weakest link' of a hotel to instigate a room upgrade . Justin Ross Lee is an internet celebrity and socialite who in 2011 founded Pretentious Pocket, a silk pocket square business.

And came across as ‘a bit grand, awkward and bored, rather than enthusiastic’, according to one insider. ‘Cringe-worthy’ said another . Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery. 'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.' Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. 'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued.

        "input": "Devon Still shared some amazing news about his daughter Leah on Wednesday. The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, was told that her cancer is in remission. 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram. Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Wednesday that his daughter Leah's cancer was in remisison . Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease . 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram . He went on to say; 'After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her.' He then went on to thank everyone from the doctors who helped his daughter to those who wrote her notes and everyone who shared her story. Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy. She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research. In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment. Leah and her dad have also written a book that aims to help children who are battling the disease . The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance . Leah's MBIG scans showed no active disease in her body, though the family is still waiting on an MRI and bone biopsy results . Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys. The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play. The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage. June 2, 2014 and March 25, 2015 are days I will remember for the rest of my life. As everyone probably knows, June 2nd was the day doctors walked into the waiting room to tell me my daughter had cancer. It was the most devastating day of my life. March 25th , however, is feeling like the best day of my life. Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION! After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her. It was not easy but every day, and every treatment Leah fought like hell and kicked cancers butt! I'm so proud and blessed to call her my daughter. She has made an impact on me and on the world, at the age of four, that I can only wish to make in a lifetime. Thank you to my family and friends for the support through all those tough days. Thank you to everyone who has sent a letter to give Leah and our family motivation to keep fighting, a toy that helped Leah get through her days in the hospital, and more importantly a prayer that helped God hear our cries for healing. Thank you to the doctors at CHOP for putting together the best plan of action for my daughter. Thank you to Child Life members Sarah, Laura, and Lindsey for really turning what could be a scary place into a place where Leah would enjoy going because she knew she would have fun with you guys. Thank you to the Bengals for taking on my situation and standing by me and my family and for helping to raise money to fight pediatric cancer. To every media outlet and persons that helped raise much needed awareness, thank you. Leah is not done with treatments yet. She still needs more to make sure the cancer cells do not return and to build back up her immune system and other damage from the chemo but I know my little warrior will get through it!",

        "input": "American socialite Justin Ross Lee is the star of an outrageous feature video where he is portrayed as a Frank Abagnale style travel industry hack. Basing himself on the fraudster who posed as a pilot and inspired the Hollywood movie Catch Me If You Can, the socialite has shared a host of controversial hacks on how he secures upgrades and better hotel rooms when travelling. His video tips, which can only be taken as tongue-in-cheek, appears to show the young globetrotter adopting multiple personas as he travels in order to achieve elite status at airports. Justin claims that he uses the first class lounge as an office space because there is WIFI, free food and unlimited alcohol . He claims that he doesn’t scam airlines, but instead takes advantage of where there are holes before referring to himself as an ‘international Jew jetter’ – a term he uses to describe his lifestyle. He then states that people find serenity in places like central park and that he finds his grounded at JFK airport. ‘I use the first class lounge as an office space. There’s WIFI, free food, unlimited alcohol,’ he says. Justin has a tip for getting your seat moved during a flight and it involves chutz pah and a bag of peanuts . ‘Why spend money on an office space when I can just come here?’ It is at this point that the socialite begins revealing hacks by explaining to the viewer what it is they have to do if they want to stay in the first class lounge for free all day. And, according to Justin, it’s as simple as buying a refundable ticket to get past security and cancelling it at the end of the day. The American socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale, the con-artist the film ‘Catch Me If You Can’ is centred around . Depart at arrivals . According to Justin the best way to arrival at an airport is to do so via arrivals. This way there is no queuing while getting in and you are only required to use a single escalator once through the doors. Never lose your luggage . It’s the age-old problem with airlines, the worry of losing your luggage. But Justin has an inadvisable way of supposedly ensuring that doesn't happen. He believes that by simply packing a gun – not necessarily a real one – and then declaring it will ensure the airline keeps a close eye on baggage throughout the journey. Get your seat moved . Now on the plane, Justin has a tip for getting away from someone you don’t want to be sitting next to. Involving a prop this time, the socialite recommends crushing a packet of peanuts, feigning an allergy and simply requesting to be moved. Upgrade your room . So you’ve arrived at the hotel but you don’t like your room. Justin has the solution. By doing ‘at least 45 minutes worth of research’ the socialite looks for the most empowered, weakest link among the staff and appears to prey upon them with complaints until they break. Business cards . Finally Justin recommends getting yourself an array of business cards, which show that you work for a number of different businesses. This way if there is a particular offer for that company you are eligible for it. Next the socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale by suggesting that he has ‘chutz pah’ (shameless audacity) just like him. The video concludes with Justin reading through some of the hate mail he has received before stating that he is doing something right because he has given them something to talk about. And noting that he would hate to be normal. The video shows Justin supposedly talking to the 'most empowered, weakest link' of a hotel to instigate a room upgrade . Justin Ross Lee is an internet celebrity and socialite who in 2011 founded Pretentious Pocket, a silk pocket square business. Born in Scarsdale, New York, Justin attended private preparatory high school Brewster Academy. He holds an undergraduate degree in entrepreneurship as well as a Master's Degree in Business from University of Hartford. The American socialite claims that you would have to be ‘pretty stupid’ to not have your elite status . To view the full video on the Elite Daily YouTube channel please click here.",
