    "input": "Even the more well-travelled among us would struggle to scratch the surface of Unesco's World Heritage List. Jaw-dropping scenery, ancient monuments and incredible wildlife are just a few of the 1007 sites earmarked for preservation by the organisation. But while well-known destinations such as Machu Picchu and the Acropolis in Athens may feature prominently on many intrepid explorers' 'to do' list, there are a number of stunning sites that the majority of us will simply never get to see. Here, we highlight a number of Unesco World Heritage sites that due to conflict, or deterioration, risk being lost to us forever - as well as a few destinations that you may be able to see for yourself... but only if you're quick. Scroll down for video . The UNESCO World Heritage sites you may never get to see: . Afghanistan - Minaret of Jam . The glorious Minaret of Jam has was built in the 12th century by\u00a0Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din and marks the ancient city of Firuzkuh . The Minaret - in the Ghor province in Afghanistan - is covered in intricate brickwork and blue tiles arranged in Kufic inscription . It has survived countless wars and pillaging  the but Minaret of Jam - situated in a remote spot in the Ghor province of Afghanistan - is facing its biggest challenge yet. Extensive restoration work is needed to preserve the ancient structure, which is at risk from erosion from a nearby riverbed as well as a compromising tilt, similar to the tower at Pisa. The 65 meter needle was built in 1194 by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din, and is covered in intricate geometric brickwork as well as Kufic inscription in dazzling blue tiles - yet most people will never get to see the Minaret. Not only is the monument miles away from the nearest human settlement, it lies in a dangerous Taliban stronghold making travel to the region virtually impossible. North-West Iraq - Samarra Archaeological City . The Great Mosque and spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which has yet to be excavated . The archaelogical city at Samarra in Northern Iraq marks the site of a powerful Islamic capital city that ruled the region for much of the 9th century. The Great Mosque and soaring spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which have yet to be excavated. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, this rich cultural landscape is out of bounds. The city is located in the North-West of Iraq which remains in the grip of a bitter and ongoing conflict between local militia, Isis and Kurdish forces. When, and indeed if, the remaining site will be excavated is doubtful. Ancient city of Aleppo - Syria . The city of Aleppo was named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today . The Grand Mosque in the ancient city of Aleppo is at risk due to the ongoing civil war that blights the country . Syria's rich and glorious cultural heritage is demonstrated by the sheer volume of ancient monuments and historic sites that punctuate this embattled landscape. The ancient city of Aleppo contains elaborate mosques, palaces and evidence of a Graeco-Roman street layout, and there are signs of occupation dating back as far at the 10th-century BC. Hinting at its former glory, the city was even named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today.The country is in the grip of a bloody and bitter civil war that shows no signs of abating, and the Foreign Office advises against all travel to the war-torn country. Bethlehem - Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route . The Church of the Nativity is located within the Palestine occupied West Bank, an area that holidaymakers are advised to avoid . The alleged birthplace of Jesus: Positioned in the Palestine occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' Six miles south of Jerusalem, on the site Christians have called the birthplace of Jesus since the 2nd century, is the Church of Nativity. The oldest church in daily use in the world, the original basilica  was built in 339 AD, and parts of it survive below ground. A cave, over which the first Church was built, is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. While the site sees streams of religious visitors, its positioning in the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' means it's not one for the average tourist. And even if you do get to it, the church is in danger of crumbling - with the roof structure being vulnerable to lack of maintenance and repair. And due to an increase in the number of vehicles, as well as unregulated tourism, pollution now affects its outside walls. Its preservation relies on the unlikely partnership of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, so it remains at high risk. Timbuktu - Mali . Timbuktu was founded in the 5th century and came to prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries when it was a centre for learning . Desertification has left many of Timbuktu's buildings vulnerable, while political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel . Remote, yet endlessly fascinating, Timbuktu  has become synonymous with inaccessibility over the centuries. Once hailed as the intellectual and spiritual capital of Islam in Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries, today the city remains as distant and increasingly isolated. Founded in the 5th century, Timbuktu was previously a thriving economic and cultural hub in spite of its isolation, and the mosques and holy shrines in the city once played an essential role in the spread of Islam throuhgout Africa. Situated in the gateway to the Sahara desert, the ancient mosques and libraries of Timbuktu are under now at the mercy of the elements. Climate change and desertification has left many of the buildings vulnerable, and continued political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel. Democratic Republic of Congo - Kahuzi-Biega National Park . Kahuzi-Biega National Park (right) is home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas (left) - but only around 250 remain . The Kahuzi-Biega National Park covers a vast area of tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo that is dominated by two dormant volcanos - Kahuzi and Biega. The Park's diverse flora and fauna make it one of the most ecologically rich in the world, let alone Africa, and it's home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas. However, despite efforts to preserve the population, only 250 gorillas remain in the park at present, and poaching and political instability in the region have left the Park exposed to worrying levels of destruction. The country is virtually off-limits to travellers with the Foreign Office guidance advising against all but essential travel to most regions. And the endangered sites should visit before they disappear: . Belize - Barrier reef . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals and clear blue water . Coastal development and tourism also put pressure on the stunning, but fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be responsible . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals, crystal-clear waters and white sandy beaches. It is also home to the a number of threatened species, including the West Indian manatee, hawksbill turtles and the American crocodile. However, much like the iconic Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the future of the reef in Belize is under constant threat from a number of factors including climate change, coral bleaching and the frequent hurricanes that blight the region. Coastal development and tourism have also put pressure on the stunning, but incredibly fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be a responsible tourist! Peru - Chimu Kingdom, Chan Chan . In its prime during the 15th century, the vast kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Columbian America . The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs . While Machu Picchu may be more well-known, the remains of the Chimu kingdom in Peru are just as fascinating. The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs, although the fragile nature of the earthen structures mean the site is slowing-but-surely eroding, so get there soon if you can. In its prime during the 15th century, the kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Colombian America and the remains of temples, dwellings, irrigation systems and funeral platforms can still be seen today. United Kingdom - Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City . Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on . A little closer to home, the city of Liverpool has a rich maritime heritage and was once a thriving commercial port. In the 18th and 19th centuries the city played an integral role in the growth the of British Empire - a legacy that remains to this day. During this time, the city pioneered the development of modern dock technology and transport systems, and was a major port for the mass emigration of people to America. Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on, despite the threat of urban sprawl and new developments that are unsympathetic to the vernacular of its historic buildings. Colombia - Los Katios National Park . Los Katios National Park is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir and the Giant Anteater (left) After years spent in the tourism doldrums, visitor numbers are finally on the increase in Colombia as the South American country enjoys a period of relative political calm. If you are planning a trip, consider a diversion to Los Katios National Park, which is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir - as well as incredible flora and fauna. Situated in the North West of the country, 95 per cent of the park is considered to be in pristine condition, but the threat of pollution, illegal hunting and agricultural sprawl remains an ever-present threat. Indonesia - Tropical rainforests of Sumatra . The parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger . This once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years due to illegal logging, among other things . The tropical rainforests in Sumatra comprises three national parks: Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Collectively, the parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger - and around 580 species of birds, making it an ideal destination for animal lovers. But this once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years. The spread of illegal logging, encroaching agriculture and poaching have devastated some parts of the rainforest and still pose a significant threat.",

    "input": "Mathematics is probably not a subject that many people find sexy, but it could hold the key to finding true love. Mathematicians have developed a series of theories that can help people find the perfect partner. These include tips such as not trying to hide the less attractive parts of your appearance in your online dating profile pictures and looking for people who had fewer colds as a child. Scroll down for video . Dr Hannah Fry's (pictured left) book (right) explains how maths underpins love. She said the Discreet Choice Theory dictates that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular . They have also proposed mathematical approaches to finding the perfect wife or husband - by not choosing to settle down until after the age of 22 years old. Dr Hannah Fry, a lecturer at University College London and author of a new book on The Mathematics of Love, outlined the theories at the Oxford Literary Festival. She said that choosing friends who are slightly less attractive than you when going out looking for love could also bring advantages. This is known as the Discreet Choice Theory, where the presence of an irrelevant alternative can change how you view your choices. In her book, Dr Hannah Fry suggest a number of techniques to help people find true love. Have friends who are less attractive than you:\u00a0Known as\u00a0Discreet Choice Theory, the idea is that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as being equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular with the men. Highlight your flaws: \u00a0Analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the 'most attractive' who get the most responses from other users. Instead it appears to be those that divide opinion - so those that have something that sets them apart from the rest of the crowds. Men with bald heads, for example, should not wear a hat to cover their pate as their lack of hair will be attractive to some. Those who are overweight should also not use clever photo cropping to hide what they perceive as flaws. This means people who find these traits attractive will face less competition than messaging those who have 'perfect' profile pictures. This formula produced by psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation.\u00a0The most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and don't let trivial problems build up . Choose 'healthy' looking partners:\u00a0Dr Fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive. Don't settle down until 37% of your 'dating period' has past:\u00a0The Optimal Stopping Period theory dictates that people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their 'dating period' has past. If, for example, they are looking to get married by the age of 35 years old, and start dating from the age of 15, they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old. After this time has past, marry the first 'best' partner you get:\u00a0After the 37 per cent period has past, Dr Fry said people should marry the first partner they find that is better than any that came before. While this might sound like a risky strategy - for example if all subsequent partners fail to live up to the dream match in their teenage years - it is actually used in nature by some species of fish when mating. And if married, follow the 'positive' formula: This formula, devised by psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation. The most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and don't let trivial problems build up. The idea is that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as being equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular with the men. Dr Fry said: 'If you are trying to choose a wingman or wingwoman, choose someone as similar to you as possible, just slightly less attractive.' Other mathematicians have dedicated a fair amount of time to the subject of finding and keeping love. One mathematician - Peter Backus who was a pHD student at Warwick University at the time - wrote a paper called 'Why I don't have a girlfriend' after a three-year love drought. He calculated - using an mathematical formula known as the Drake equation - that of all the available women in the UK, there were just 26 who were appropriate for him. He also predicted that he had just a one in 285,000 chance of meeting one of them on a night out. Video courtesy of TED\u00a0- watch the full video here . Being unconventionally attractive may also be an advantage, according to the mathematician's research. This is because it reduces competition for people who find those flaws appealing. Sarah Jessica Parker (shown) divides opinion with many people thinking she's beautiful and others disagreeing . Fortunately for him, it seems he did meet one of them - a girl called Rose from London who he met at a dinner with friends while he was working at Warwick University - and has now married her. According to Dr Fry, however, there are ways of increasing your chances of meeting the one. In her book she provides a series of mathematically supported tips for those looking to find love and keep it. It is the perfect invention for an angst-ridden teenager or a suspicious spouse - scientists have paved the way for a test that can tell if someone is truly in love. Neurologists claim to have discovered the secrets of how different emotions affect the brain. By poring over scans of people in different stages of romance, they think they have the first clues as to what true love looks like. Initial results show a dozen different areas of the brain is affected in different ways by the emotions of love. A cocktail of chemicals carry messages from one region to another, which may allow scientists in the future to use MRI scans to tell what someone truly feels. Early results published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience reveal that the team are already confident they have discovered the part of the brain - the caudate nucleus - which is most active at the end of a love affair.\u2018 . If the other parts of the puzzle can be pieced together, they may one day be able to tell exactly how someone feels with a brief scan. Analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the 'most attractive' who get the most responses from other users. Instead it appears to be those that divide opinion - so those that have something that sets them apart from the rest of the crowds. Men with bald heads, for example, should not wear a hat to cover their pate as their lack of hair will be attractive to some. Those who are overweight should also not use clever photo cropping to hide what they perceive as flaws. She explained that this is because often people who find these traits attractive will also be more likely to message as they know it is not attractive to everyone. This means they will face less competition than messaging those who have 'perfect' profile pictures. Dr Fry said: 'People who are unbelievably good looking will always do well, but the rest of us would be better to divide opinion.' She also outlined a maths based strategy for finding a wife or husband known as the Optimal Stopping Period. This states that people should only start looking for the partner you want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their 'dating period' has passed. If, for example, a oerson is looking to get married by the age of 35 years old, and starts dating from the age of 15, they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old. Meanwhile, the Optimal Stopping Period theory says people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37% of their 'dating period' has past. If, for example, they want to get married by the age of 35, and start dating at 15, they should discount all partners before the age of 22.4 years old . Neurologists recently claimed to have discovered the secrets of how different emotions affect the brain. By poring over scans of people in different stages of romance, they claim to have the first clues as to what true love looks like. The areas affected by the feeling of love are highlight . After this age they should then marry the first partner they find that is better than any that came before. While this might sound like a risky strategy - like if all subsequent partners fail to live up to your dream match in your teenage years - it is actually used in nature by some species of fish when mating. Dr Fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive. According to The Times, she said: 'As a child, every time you get a cough or a cold your face tends to grow in a slightly asymmetrical way. 'So in thinking symmetrical faces are more attractive, you are validating an underlying bill of health.' However, recent research has suggested that facial symmetry has little to do with health during childhood but more perhaps a signal of genetic 'fitness'. And for those who are already married, maths can also be used to help predict whether their relationship will last by looking for patterns. Psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray produced a formula that looks at the mood of each partner when alone, together and how they influence each other. This found that some couples often got into spirals of negativity that would ultimately lead to divorce. The most successful couples are those that allow each other room to complain and do not store up trivial things to become a bit deal. The same formula has also been used to help predict the outcomes of an arms race between countries. Speaking during a Ted Talk last year, Dr Fry said: 'Love, as with most of life, is full of patterns and mathematics is about studying patterns.'",
